# Bubbles & Fur - Archived Version

Welcome to the archived version of the Bubbles & Fur website! This project represents my first experience in creating a site for a client, providing valuable lessons and insights into web development. Since this version was published, the site has undergone significant updates to enhance performance and user experience. You can view the current version of the website on [GitHub](https://github.com/bgweaver/bubblesandfur).

## Reflections on the Project

As a web developer, each project offers new challenges and opportunities for growth. This project was no exception, and I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. Here are some key aspects I want to reflect on regarding what went well and where I see room for improvement:

### What I’m Proud Of

- **First Published Site for a Client:** This was my first official project for someone else, and seeing it live was incredibly rewarding. Delivering a site that meets a client’s needs feels like a significant milestone in my development journey.

- **Utilized Netlify for Deployment:** I used Netlify to publish the site, which was my first experience with this platform. The deployment process was smooth and efficient, making it an excellent choice for future projects.

- **Form Integration:** Including a form was a big step for me. I integrated Netlify Forms, which was another first. The form captures client inquiries and includes a honeypot entry and CAPTCHA to reduce spam—a critical feature that I’m glad I implemented after dealing with spam on my own sites.

- **Custom Email Setup:** I used ImprovMX to create a custom email address for the client. Now, instead of relying on a generic Gmail address, she has a professional bubblesandfur.com email, enhancing her brand’s credibility.

- **Animation with AOS:** To add some flair, I incorporated AOS (Animate on Scroll) to make the title and intro paragraph pop in once per session. This subtle touch adds a dynamic element to the site, improving the first impression.

- **Meeting the Client Brief:** I’m particularly proud of how I met the client’s brief while integrating it into a professional design. I adapted quickly to changes and ensured the final product aligned with her vision.

- **About Page Creation:** I wrote interview questions for the client and crafted a compelling “About the Business” page based on her responses. This added a personal touch, helping visitors connect with the brand on a deeper level.

- **Expanded Use of Bootstrap:** I expanded my use of Bootstrap in this project, ensuring the navigation bar collapses seamlessly and that the site is responsive across different devices.

- **Meta Tags for Enhanced Sharing:** Implementing meta tags was a small but impactful feature. Now, when the site link is shared, it automatically includes a custom title and image, making it more visually appealing on social media and messaging apps.

- **Site Indexing and Google Business Entry:** I successfully indexed the site with Google Search Console and created a Google Business entry, improving the site’s visibility and online presence.

## Conclusion

This project not only showcased my skills as a web developer but also provided me with valuable insights into client collaboration and project management. While there’s always room for improvement, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and excited to take these lessons into future projects.
